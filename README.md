Identifying risk involved is always a challenge. As banks deal with several risks daily, it is critical to assess the risk profile of the customers being dealt with. It may result in financial losses for the bank if the right risk associated with each customer is not identified.

Based on the following parameters, we can rate a customer into high, medium and low risk profiles. This helps banks in dealing with each customer according to their risk profile.

Parameters that banks utilise to  identify the risk ratings of a given customer:

Limit structure (more overdrafts, more credit limits)
Balances (negative or low average balance)
KYC ratings
Deposits and loans (more loans)
Loan or overdrafts repayments (failed/delay to repay)
Industry they belong to (risky industries such as wood-based industries)
Country of origin/business (risk countries like Libya, Haiti and Chad)
       * Above mentioned points in brackets are to be considered as more risk.
